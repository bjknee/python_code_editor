The group has communicated very well throughout the first stages of the project, whether in our group discord channel
or during meetings. Everyone is contributing to the work, and have been actively completing tasks and laying the
groundwork for the rest of our project completion. Kayla had stepped up to take the role of scrum master for our first
meeting and did a fantastic job organizing and mediating our first discussion. Gizem has done a great job with the
documentation for our 5th submission. Brian has done excellently with setting up the first iteration of how the
CodeServer will look, and implemented some functionality. The code our group has written so far is well-written.
