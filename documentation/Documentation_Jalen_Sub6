For this submission, I worked on implementing user login and verification, including a "login" method that was written
in recoverwork.py and added to codesender.py for final submission, as well as login.html which implements a login page
before entering the code server page. I also worked on methods to add code to the database and recover it after it had
been saved by the user.

This implementation involved pulling information from the login page and comparing it against information pulled from
the database. If there are any discrepancies from the entered information and the database of users, login is not
possible and a message is given to the user to let them know that their credentials are invalid.
