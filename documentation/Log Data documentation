Log Data Documentation
Date: December 05, 2022.

The Log Data task was implemented using the Flask framework. This part of the project was added to the codesender.py
as it would have to be activated with the server. The log data method produces a log file that tracks all codeserver
application activity, with the username, timestamp and what part of the application is being accessed and/or
what activity is being performed. The log data method, using Flask, accounts for all activity, errors and warnings
produced in running the application.
