Meeting Minutes:

For cycle 6, Jalen is SCRUM master, Kayla is Note Taker and Brian is Technical Lead.

Gizem is the manager of pull requests for this cycle.

Confusion surrounding acceptable submission of Individual Tasks was resolved.

The additional Individual tasks, added to the KanBan board by Kayla, were allocated and the task assignments (for cycle 6) are as follows:

Jalen - "Recover work", "User logins and passwords"
Gizem - "Template" module, "Profile and personal code spaces"
Brian - "Server Setup" (maintenance from cycle 5), "Upload/Download code segments", "Save-Revert buttons" (maintenance of initial work from cycle 5), "Flask framework
         endpoint routing"
Kayla - "Persist Storage" module (maintenance from cycle 6), "Database complete upgrade"

It was established that this cycle indicates that our individual tasks are interconnected, making it important that our workflow be timely and seamless as possible.
Issues were added to the Issue Tracker as needed and discussed in our Discord server chat.
