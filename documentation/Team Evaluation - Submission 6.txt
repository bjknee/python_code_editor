Team G - Team Evaluation for Submission 6:
Our team has continued to work well together to accomplish the given tasks. We are all actively contributing to the
project and our separate work is coming together in a functional way. Our communication is excellent as a group, we all
listen to each otherâ€™s input during meetings, and everyone makes sure to allow the others to contribute. Our group also
communicates via a discord server and readily help each other with any issues that come up.
