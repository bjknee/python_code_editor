Penelope is a 4th year Computer Science student, 
working on an undergraduate Honours project.
When using other IDEs, a unittest module is readily available
to test her project's performance.

When she uses the codeServer application, there is no 
testing module available. There is no way to 
ensure that her project is working effectively.
She also has no option to share her work in the application
with someone else for code review.
