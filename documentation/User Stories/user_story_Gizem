Su is a third year computer science student at MUN.

Today when she was in her class, she wanted to try out something by adding some more code to her existing code and see what kind of output it would
produce, but since she did not bring her laptop to MUN today, she could not do that. She wished that she could have recovered her previous python code
entry by an instance running on a remote server accessible through any web brower existed so that she could have added to her code anywhere on any device
like a tablet or phone with a consistent IDE ( integreated development enviroment ) after being able to identify herself on the server.
