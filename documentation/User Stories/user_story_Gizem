Burak is a third year computer science student at MUN.
Today when he was in his class, he wanted to try out something by coding and see what kind of output it would produce, but
since he did not bring his laptop to MUN today, he could not do that. He wished that he had an instance running
on a remote server accessible through any web brower existed so that he could have coded anywhere on any device like a tablet or phone with  a
consistent IDE ( integreated development enviroment ).
