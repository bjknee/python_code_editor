Su is a third year computer science student at MUN.

Today when she was in his class, she wanted to try out something by adding some more code to his existing code and see what kind of output it would
produce, but since she did not bring his laptop to MUN today, she could not do that. She wished that he had an instance running
on a remote server accessible through any web brower existed so that he could have added to her code anywhere on any device like a tablet or phone with a
consistent IDE ( integreated development enviroment ) after being able to identify herself and recover her previous python code entry after server
restart
