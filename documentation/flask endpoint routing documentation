To implement Flask into the application, we needed to completely refactor the existing code base. The initial functions
at the top of codesender handle the base functionality that was present in submission 5. We changed up our directory
structure to better suit this type of development as importing each additional module as its own sudo python package
ended up causing more issues that it was solving. In response to this, we encouraged decoupling through sectioning off
areas in the codesender.py file for specific modules. To provide additional decoupling to the serverStorage module we placed
the app and database initialization in the serverDB file and made the codesender file only responsible for routing.
