Instead of using python to upload and download code files from the codesender app, I instead
decided to use two simple javascript files to handle this functionality on the client side.
This made the implementation much easier as there is no writing the files and pulling them from
the database. Users can upload any text files from their local machine directly into the coding space.
When downloading the code, users can download exactly what is represented in the coding space into
a text file from the browser. As a reference to create these files I used the two sites listed above.
