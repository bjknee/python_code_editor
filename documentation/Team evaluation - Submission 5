    The group has communicated very well throughout the first stages of the project, whether in our group discord channel
or during meetings. The team was able to come together, despite conflicting schedules and other commitments, via Discord
and our first SCRUM meeting. We tried our best too collaboratively understand what was asked of us in our Team Tasks and
everyone was open to being corrected when necessary. 
Everyone is contributing to the work, and have been actively completing tasks and laying the groundwork for the rest of
our project completion. Kayla had stepped up to take the role of scrum master for our first meeting and did a fantastic
job organizing and mediating our first discussion. Gizem has done a great job with the documentation for our 5th submission.
Brian has done excellently with setting up the first iteration of how the CodeServer will look, and implemented some functionality.
The code our group has written so far is well-written.
One of the main sources of confusion throughout the first development cycle was trying to translate what was asked of
in the individual tasks into features for the application. With a clearer understanding of what each module is responsible
for, we are more confident in our ability to delegate appropriate tasks to team members working on related modules.
