To implement the database module, it must work in response to the method calls associated with the codesender package.
The database module has a User table object, that include the username, password and code segment unique to each user. The Admin
table object includes the admin username and password. Other table objects can be added and the database can be scaled easily.
It is expected that when methods such as add_user, add_code and user_list are called, the database will be launched for queries,
as needed.
