For the syntax markup functionality I implemented the javascript library CodeMirror. It natively covered most of the
functionality required for the project in making the user inputted code more readable. There was some minor refactoring
done to the upload.js and download.js files because CodeMirror handles text input slightly differently than a vanilla
text area. I decided to include the library in the project files for longevity, importing the library as a CDN
could have caused future issue. All functionality is still currently intact and the text area now reads more like an
actual IDE rather just plain text on a web page.
