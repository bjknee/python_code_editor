to be implemented for submission 6


An html page templating solution will be created so future features will be able to  use multiple pages with different kinds of feedback.
All code tasks will include appropriate unit test for regression testing. The module must be appropriately decoupled
from the rest of the code base with a well defined API that allows the implementation to be changed.
