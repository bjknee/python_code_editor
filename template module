"""
to be implemented for submission 6


I will create an html page templating solution, so that future features will be able to use multiple pages with different kinds of feedback.
All code tasks will include appropriate unit test for regression testing, and the module will be appropriately decoupled
from the rest of the code base with a well defined API that allows the implementation to be changed.
