This module will be implemented for submission 6.

My goal is to work with Kayla's serverStorage module to implement username recognition when a user starts
work in the virtual environment.
    -The interface will be changed to show a "Log In" button that prompts the user to enter their username.
        -This will likely use the checkUser method from serverStorage.
    -Using retrieveCode method, the user will select the previous code that they wish to continue working
    on, and any changes will be saved to the corresponding shelve file.
        -Whether this is done through a command or through a menu of the user's saved code is not yet
        decided.
        -An idea is a dropdown menu of previously saved work that the user can select from.
