G Team Documentation 

Submission 5: 

Meeting 1 (Oct 24th) in person summary ( everyone was able to attend ) : 

We talked about: 

The technical terms like the ‘KanBan board’ , ‘pull requests’, ‘DRY’, ‘user story’ 

How there are 3 roles, and we are 4 people total, so we decided that we will switch the roles for each submission. For each submission, one person will not have a role of either being a scrum master, note taker or handling with the pull requests/technical lead. 

For the first submission’s meetings, Kayla has been/will be the scrum master, Gizem will be the note taker and Jalen will be the technical lead. 

Importance of time management, as a team we decided that the last time to make a pull request will be the last day before the due date. 

 The notes of what we need to submit for submission 5 

When would be the best day for our team meetings, we decided that Mondays are good in general to meet in person, and if somehow it does not work, we have made a group chat in Discord, so we can always have online meetings on there. 

Kayla made a list of the questions to ask Mr. Brown. 

KanBan board labels. We fixed the label issues, we have the labels ‘issues’ , ‘bugs’ , ‘tasks’, ‘group in progress’ , ‘group tasks’ , ‘done’ , and each individual’s tasks ( for 4 people ) . 

Second meeting (online meeting on Oct 30th , everyone but Jalen was able to attend.) 

We discussed about: 

The user story that Jalen came up with, how to make it better 

Where everyone is at and what they have been doing 

Brian will deal with the pull requests.

The last pull request for submisson 5 will be on November 2nd.
